# V4: Access Control Verification Requirements

Authorization is the concept of allowing access to resources only to those permitted to use them. Ensure that a
verified application satisfies the following high level requirements:
* Persons accessing resources hold valid credentials to do so.
* Users are associated with a well-defined set of roles and privileges.
* Role and permission metadata is protected from replay or tampering.
