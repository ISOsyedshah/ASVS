| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 4.1.1 | Verify that the application enforces access control rules on a trusted service layer, especially if client-side access control is present and could be bypassed.  | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 602 |
| 4.1.2 | Verify that all user and data attributes and policy information used by access controls cannot be manipulated by end users unless specifically authorized. | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   |639 |
| 4.1.3 | Verify that the principle of least privilege exists - users should only be able to access functions, data files, URLs, controllers, services, and other resources, for which they possess specific authorization. This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege. | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 285 |
| 4.1.4 | Verify that the principle of deny by default exists whereby new users/roles start with minimal or no permissions and users/roles do not receive access to new features until access is explicitly assigned. | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 276|
| 4.1.5 | Verify that access controls fail securely including when an exception occurs. | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   |285 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
