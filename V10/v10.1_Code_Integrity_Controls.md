# 10.1 Code Integrity Controls

The best defense against malicious code is "trust, but verify". Introducing unauthorized or malicious code into code is often a criminal offence in many jurisdictions. Policies and procedures should make sanctions regarding malicious code clear.
Lead developers should regularly review code check-ins, particularly those that might access time, I/O, or network functions.
