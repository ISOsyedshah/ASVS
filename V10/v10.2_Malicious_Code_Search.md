# 10.2 Malicious Code Search

Malicious code is extremely rare and is difficult to detect. Manual line by line code review can assist looking for logic bombs, but even the most experienced code reviewer will struggle to find malicious code even if they know it exists.
Complying with this section is not possible without complete access to source code, including third-party libraries.
