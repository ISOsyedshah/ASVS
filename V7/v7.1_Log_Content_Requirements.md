# 7.1 Log Content Requirements

Logging sensitive information is dangerous - the logs become classified themselves, which means they need to be encrypted, become subject to retention policies, and must be disclosed in security audits. Ensure only necessary information is kept in logs, and certainly no payment, credentials (including session tokens), sensitive or personally identifiable information.
V7.1 covers OWASP Top 10 2017:A10. As 2017:A10 and this section are not penetration testable, it's important for:
•	Developers to ensure full compliance with this section, as if all items were marked as L1
•	Penetration testers to validate full compliance of all items in V7.1 via interview, screenshots, or assertion

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 7.1.1 | Verify that the application does not log credentials or payment details. Session tokens should only be stored in logs in an irreversible, hashed form.| ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 532 |
| 7.1.2 | Verify that the application does not log other sensitive data as defined under local privacy laws or relevant security policy.   | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 532 |
| 7.1.3 | Verify that the application logs security relevant events including successful and failed authentication events, access control failures, deserialization failures and input validation failures.  | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 778 |
| 7.1.4 | Verify that each log event includes necessary information that would allow for a detailed investigation of the timeline when an event happens.  | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 778 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
