# 7.4 Error Handling

The purpose of error handling is to allow the application to provide security relevant events for monitoring, triage and escalation. The purpose is not to create logs. When logging security related events, ensure that there is a purpose to the log, and that it can be distinguished by SIEM or analysis software.

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 7.4.1 | Verify that a generic message is shown when an unexpected or security sensitive error occurs, potentially with a unique ID which support personnel can use to investigate. | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 210|
| 7.4.2 | Verify that exception handling (or a functional equivalent) is used across the codebase to account for expected and unexpected error conditions.    | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 544 |
| 7.4.3 | Verify that a "last resort" error handler is defined which will catch all unhandled exceptions.   | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 460 |

Note: Certain languages, such as Swift and Go - and through common design practice - many functional languages, do not support exceptions or last resort event handlers. In this case, architects and developers should use a pattern, language, or framework friendly way to ensure that applications can securely handle exceptional, unexpected, or security-related events.

Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
