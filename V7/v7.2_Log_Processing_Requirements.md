# 7.2 Log Processing Requirements

Timely logging is critical for audit events, triage, and escalation. Ensure that the application's logs are clear and can be easily monitored and analyzed either locally or log shipped to a remote monitoring system.
V7.2 covers OWASP Top 10 2017:A10. As 2017:A10 and this section are not penetration testable, it's important for:
•	Developers to ensure full compliance with this section, as if all items were marked as L1
•	Penetration testers to validate full compliance of all items in V7.2 via interview, screenshots, or assertion
