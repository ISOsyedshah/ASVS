# 7.3 Log Protection Requirements

Logs that can be trivially modified or deleted are useless for investigations and prosecutions. Disclosure of logs can expose inner details about the application or the data it contains. Care must be taken when protecting logs from unauthorized disclosure, modification or deletion.

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 7.3.1 | Verify that the application appropriately encodes user-supplied data to prevent log injection. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 117 |
| 7.3.2 | Verify that all events are protected from injection when viewed in log viewing software.   | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 117 |
| 7.3.3 | Verify that security logs are protected from unauthorized access and modification.   | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 200 |
| 7.3.4 | Verify that time sources are synchronized to the correct time and time zone. Strongly consider logging only in UTC if systems are global to assist with post-incident forensic analysis.   | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   |  |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.

Note: Log encoding (7.3.1) is difficult to test and review using automated dynamic tools and penetration tests, but architects, developers, and source code reviewers should consider it an L1 requirement.
