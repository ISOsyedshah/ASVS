# 6.3 Random Values

True pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) is incredibly difficult to get right. Generally, good sources of entropy within a system will be quickly depleted if over-used, but sources with less randomness can lead to predictable keys and secrets.

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 6.3.1 | Verify that all random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs, and random strings are generated using the cryptographic module's approved cryptographically secure random number generator when these random values are intended to be not guessable by an attacker. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 338 |
| 6.3.2 | Verify that random GUIDs are created using the GUID v4 algorithm, and a cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). GUIDs created using other pseudo-random number generators may be predictable. | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 338 |
| 6.3.3 | Verify that random numbers are created with proper entropy even when the application is under heavy load, or that the application degrades gracefully in such circumstances. | X	 | X   | ✓   | 338|

Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
