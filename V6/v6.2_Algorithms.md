# 6.2 Algorithms

Recent advances in cryptography mean that previously safe algorithms and key lengths are no longer safe or sufficient to protect data. Therefore, it should be possible to change algorithms.
Although this section is not easily penetration tested, developers should consider this entire section as mandatory even though L1 is missing from most of the items


| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 6.2.1 | Verify that all cryptographic modules fail securely, and errors are handled in a way that does not enable Padding Oracle attacks.| ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 310 |
| 6.2.2 | Verify that industry proven or government approved cryptographic algorithms, modes, and libraries are used, instead of custom coded cryptography.  | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 327 |
| 6.2.3 | Verify that encryption initialization vector, cipher configuration, and block modes are configured securely using the latest advice. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326|
| 6.2.4 | Verify that random number, encryption or hashing algorithms, key lengths, rounds, ciphers or modes, can be reconfigured, upgraded, or swapped at any time, to protect against cryptographic breaks | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326|
| 6.2.5 | Verify that known insecure block modes (i.e. ECB, etc.), padding modes (i.e. PKCS#1 v1.5, etc.), ciphers with small block sizes (i.e. Triple-DES, Blowfish, etc.), and weak hashing algorithms (i.e. MD5, SHA1, etc.) are not used unless required for backwards compatibility. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326|
| 6.2.6 | Verify that nonces, initialization vectors, and other single use numbers must not be used more than once with a given encryption key. The method of generation must be appropriate for the algorithm being used. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326|
| 6.2.7 | Verify that encrypted data is authenticated via signatures, authenticated cipher modes, or HMAC to ensure that ciphertext is not altered by an unauthorized party. | X	 | X   | ✓   | 326|
| 6.2.8 | Verify that all cryptographic operations are constant-time, with no 'short-circuit' operations in comparisons, calculations, or returns, to avoid leaking information. | X	 | X   | ✓   | 385|

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
