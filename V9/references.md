### Notes on “Approved modes of TLS”. In the past, the ASVS referred to the US standard FIPS 140-2, but as a global standard, applying US standards can be difficult, contradictory, or confusing to apply. A better method of achieving compliance with 9.1.3 would be to review guides such as [Mozilla's Server Side TLS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS) or [generate known good configurations](https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/), and use known TLS evaluation tools, such as sslyze, various vulnerability scanners or trusted TLS online assessment services to obtain a desired level of security. In general, we see non-compliance for this section being the use of outdated or insecure ciphers and algorithms, the lack of perfect forward secrecy, outdated or insecure SSL protocols, weak preferred ciphers, and so on.
