# 9.2 Server Communications Security Requirements

Server communications are more than just HTTP. Secure connections to and from other systems, such as monitoring systems, management tools, remote access and ssh, middleware, database, mainframes, partner or external source systems — must be in place. All of these must be encrypted to prevent "hard on the outside, trivially easy to intercept on the inside".
| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 9.2.1 | Verify that connections to and from the server use trusted TLS certificates. Where internally generated or self-signed certificates are used, the server must be configured to only trust specific internal CAs and specific self-signed certificates. All others should be rejected.| X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 295 |
| 9.2.2 | Verify that encrypted communications such as TLS is used for all inbound and outbound connections, including for management ports, monitoring, authentication, API, or web service calls, database, cloud, serverless, mainframe, external, and partner connections. The server must not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols.  | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 319 |
| 9.2.3 | Verify that all encrypted connections to external systems that involve sensitive information or functions are authenticated. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 287 |
| 9.2.4 | Verify that proper certification revocation, such as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Stapling, is enabled and configured. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 299 |
| 9.2.5 | Verify that backend TLS connection failures are logged. | X	 | X   | ✓   | 544 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
