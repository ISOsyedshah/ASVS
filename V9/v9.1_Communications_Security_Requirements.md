# 9.1 Communications Security Requirements

All client communications should only take place over encrypted communication paths. In particular, the use of TLS 1.2 or later is essentially all but required by modern browsers and search engines. Configuration should be regularly reviewed using online tools to ensure that the latest leading practices are in place.
| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 9.1.1 | Verify that secured TLS is used for all client connectivity, and does not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols. | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 319 |
| 9.1.2 | Verify using online or up to date TLS testing tools that only strong algorithms, ciphers, and protocols are enabled, with the strongest algorithms and ciphers set as preferred.  | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326 |
| 9.1.3 | Verify that old versions of SSL and TLS protocols, algorithms, ciphers, and configuration are disabled, such as SSLv2, SSLv3, or TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. The latest version of TLS should be the preferred cipher suite.  | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326 |


*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
