# 13.2 RESTful Web Service Verification Requirements

JSON schema validation is in a draft stage of standardization (see references). When considering using JSON schema validation, which is best practice for SOAP web services, consider using these additional data validation strategies in combination with JSON schema validation:
•	Parsing validation of the JSON object, such as if there are missing or extra elements.
•	Validation of the JSON object values using standard input validation methods, such as data type, data format, length, etc.
•	and formal JSON schema validation.
Once the JSON schema validation standard is formalized, ASVS will update its advice in this area. Carefully monitor any JSON schema validation libraries in use, as they will need to be updated regularly until the standard is formalized and bugs are ironed out of reference implementations.

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 13.2.1 | Verify that enabled RESTful HTTP methods are a valid choice for the user or action, such as preventing normal users using DELETE or PUT on protected API or resources.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 650 |
| 13.2.2 | Verify that JSON schema validation is in place and verified before accepting input.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 20 |
| 13.2.3 | Verify that RESTful web services that utilize cookies are protected from Cross-Site Request Forgery via the use of at least one or more of the following: triple or double submit cookie pattern (see references), CSRF nonces, or ORIGIN request header checks.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 352
| 13.2.4 | Verify that REST services have anti-automation controls to protect against excessive calls, especially if the API is unauthenticated.| X   | ✓   | ✓   | 779
| 13.2.5 | Verify that REST services explicitly check the incoming Content-Type to be the expected one, such as application/xml or application/JSON.| X   | ✓   | ✓   | 436
| 13.2.6 | Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not modified in transit. Requiring strong encryption for transport (TLS only) may be sufficient in many cases as it provides both confidentiality and integrity protection. Per-message digital signatures can provide additional assurance on top of the transport protections for high-security applications but bring with them additional complexity and risks to weigh against the benefits.| X   | ✓   | ✓   | 345

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
