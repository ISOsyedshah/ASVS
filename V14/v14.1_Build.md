# 14.1 Build

Build pipelines are the basis for repeatable security - every time something insecure is discovered, it can be resolved in the source code, build or deployment scripts, and tested automatically. We are strongly encouraging the use of build pipelines with automatic security and dependency checks that warn or break the build to prevent known security issues being deployed into production. Manual steps performed irregularly directly leads to avoidable security mistakes.
As the industry moves to a DevSecOps model, it is important to ensure the continued availability and integrity of deployment and configuration to achieve a "known good" state. In the past, if a system was hacked, it would take days to months to prove that no further intrusions had taken place. Today, with the advent of software defined infrastructure, rapid A/B deployments with zero downtime, and automated containerized builds, it is possible to automatically and continuously build, harden, and deploy a "known good" replacement for any compromised system.
If traditional models are still in place, then manual steps must be taken to harden and back up that configuration to allow the compromised systems to be quickly replaced with high integrity, uncompromised systems in a timely fashion.
Compliance with this section requires an automated build system, and access to build and deployment scripts.

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 14.1.1 | Verify that the application build and deployment processes are performed in a secure and repeatable way, such as CI / CD automation, automated configuration management, and automated deployment scripts.| X   | ✓   | ✓   |   |
| 14.1.2 | Verify that compiler flags are configured to enable all available buffer overflow protections and warnings, including stack randomization, data execution prevention, and to break the build if an unsafe pointer, memory, format string, integer, or string operations are found.| X   | ✓   | ✓   | 120 |
| 14.1.3 | Verify that server configuration is hardened as per the recommendations of the application server and frameworks in use.| X   | ✓   | ✓   | 16
| 14.1.4 | Verify that the application, configuration, and all dependencies can be re-deployed using automated deployment scripts, built from a documented and tested runbook in a reasonable time, or restored from backups in a timely fashion.| X   | ✓   | ✓   |
| 14.1.5 | Verify that authorized administrators can verify the integrity of all security-relevant configurations to detect tampering.| X   | X   | ✓   |
