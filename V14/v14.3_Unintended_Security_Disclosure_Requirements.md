# 14.3 Unintended Security Disclosure Requirements

Configurations for production should be hardened to protect against common attacks, such as debug consoles, raise the bar for cross-site scripting (XSS) and remote file inclusion (RFI) attacks, and to eliminate trivial information discovery "vulnerabilities" that are the unwelcome hallmark of many penetration testing reports. Many of these issues are rarely rated as a significant risk, but they are chained together with other vulnerabilities. If these issues are not present by default, it raises the bar before most attacks can succeed.

| 14.3.1 | Verify that web or application server and framework error messages are configured to deliver user actionable, customized responses to eliminate any unintended security disclosures.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 209  |
| 14.3.2 | Verify that web or application server and application framework debug modes are disabled in production to eliminate debug features, developer consoles, and unintended security disclosures.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 497 |
| 14.3.3 | Verify that the HTTP headers or any part of the HTTP response do not expose detailed version information of system components.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 200 |
