# 14.2 Dependency

Dependency management is critical to the safe operation of any application of any type. Failure to keep up to date with outdated or insecure dependencies is the root cause of the largest and most expensive attacks to date.
Note: At Level 1, 14.2.1 compliance relates to observations or detections of client-side and other libraries and components, rather than the more accurate build-time static code analysis or dependency analysis. These more accurate techniques could be discoverable by interview as required.
| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 14.2.1 | Verify that all components are up to date, preferably using a dependency checker during build or compile time.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 1026  |
| 14.2.2 | Verify that all unneeded features, documentation, samples, configurations are removed, such as sample applications, platform documentation, and default or example users.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 1002 |
| 14.2.3 | Verify that if application assets, such as JavaScript libraries, CSS stylesheets or web fonts, are hosted externally on a content delivery network (CDN) or external provider, Subresource Integrity (SRI) is used to validate the integrity of the asset.| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | 714 |
| 14.2.4 | Verify that third party components come from pre-defined, trusted and continually maintained repositories.| X   | ✓   | ✓   | 829 |
| 14.2.5 | Verify that an inventory catalogue is maintained of all third party libraries in use. | X   | ✓   | ✓   |
| 14.2.6 | Verify that the attack surface is reduced by sandboxing or encapsulating third party libraries to expose only the required behaviour into the application. | X   | ✓   | ✓   | 265 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
