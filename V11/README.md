# V11: Business Logic Verification Requirements

## Control Objective
Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high level requirements:
* The business logic flow is sequential, processed in order, and cannot be bypassed.
* Business logic includes limits to detect and prevent automated attacks, such as continuous small funds transfers, or adding a million friends one at a time, and so on.
* High value business logic flows have considered abuse cases and malicious actors, and have protections against spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, and elevation of privilege attacks.
