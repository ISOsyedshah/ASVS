# 2.6 Look-up Secret Verifer Requirements

Look up secrets are pre-generated lists of secret codes, similar to Transaction Authorization Numbers (TAN), social media recovery codes, or a grid containing a set of random values. These are distributed securely to users. These lookup codes are used once, and once all used, the lookup secret list is discarded. This type of authenticator is considered "something you have".
| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		| NIST		 |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|-----------:|
| 2.6.1 | Verify that lookup secrets can be used only once. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 308 |5.1.2.2|
| 2.6.2 | Verify that lookup secrets have sufficient randomness (112 bits of entropy), or if less than 112 bits of entropy, salted with a unique and random 32-bit salt and hashed with an approved one-way hash. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 330 |5.1.2.2|
|  2.6.3 | Verify that lookup secrets are resistant to offline attacks, such as predictable values. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 310 |5.1.2.2|

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
