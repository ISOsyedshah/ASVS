# 2.9 Cryptographic Software and Devices Verifier Requirements

Cryptographic security keys are smart cards or FIDO keys, where the user has to plug in or pair the cryptographic device to the computer to complete authentication. Verifiers send a challenge nonce to the cryptographic devices or software, and the device or software calculates a response based upon a securely stored cryptographic key.
The requirements for single factor cryptographic devices and software, and multi-factor cryptographic devices and software are the same, as verification of the cryptographic authenticator proves possession of the authentication factor.

| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|-----------:|
| 2.9.1 | Verify that cryptographic keys used in verification are stored securely and protected against disclosure, such as using a TPM or HSM, or an OS service that can use this secure storage. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |5.1.7.2|
| 2.9.2 | Verify that the challenge nonce is at least 64 bits in length, and statistically unique or unique over the lifetime of the cryptographic device. | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 330 |5.1.7.2|
| 2.9.3 | Verify that approved cryptographic algorithms are used in the generation, seeding, and verification. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 327 |5.1.7.2|
