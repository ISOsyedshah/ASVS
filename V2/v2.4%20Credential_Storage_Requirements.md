# 2.4 Credential Storage Requirements

Architects and developers should adhere to this section when building or refactoring code. This section can only be fully verified using source code review or through secure unit or integration tests. Penetration testing cannot identify any of these issues.

The list of approved one-way key derivation functions is detailed in NIST 800-63 B section 5.1.1.2, and in BSI Kryptographische Verfahren: Empfehlungen und Schlussellängen (2018). The latest national or regional algorithm and key length standards can be chosen in place of these choices.

This section cannot be penetration tested, so controls are not marked as L1. However, this section is of vital importance to the security of credentials if they are stolen, so if forking the ASVS for an architecture or coding guideline or source code review checklist, please place these controls back to L1 in your private version.


| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 2.4.1 | Verify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key derivation or password hashing function. Key derivation and password hashing functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs when generating a password hash.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 250 |
|  2.4.2 | Verify that the salt is at least 32 bits in length and be chosen arbitrarily to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes. For each credential, a unique salt value and the resulting hash SHALL be stored. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
|  2.4.3 | Verify that if PBKDF2 is used, the iteration count SHOULD be as large as verification server performance will allow, typically at least 100,000 iterations| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
| 2.4.4 | Verify that if bcrypt is used, the work factor SHOULD be as large as verification server performance will allow, typically at least 13.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 250 |
|  2.4.5 | Verify that an additional iteration of a key derivation function is performed, using a salt value that is secret and known only to the verifier. Generate the salt value using an approved random bit generator [SP 800-90Ar1] and provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of SP 800-131A. The secret salt value SHALL be stored separately from the hashed passwords (e.g., in a specialized device like a hardware security module). | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
