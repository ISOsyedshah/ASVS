# 2.10 Service Authentication Requirements

This section is not penetration testable, so does not have any L1 requirements. However, if used in an architecture, coding or secure code review, please assume that software (just as Java Key Store) is the minimum requirement at L1. Clear text storage of secrets is not acceptable under any circumstances.

| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		| NIST		 |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|-----------:|
| 2.10.1 | Verify that integration secrets do not rely on unchanging passwords, such as API keys or shared privileged accounts. | X	 | OS-Assisted   | HSM   | 287 |5.1.1.1|
| 2.10.2 | Verify that if passwords are required, the credentials are not a default account. | X 	 | OS-Assisted  | HSM   | 255 |5.1.1.1|
| 2.10.3 | Verify that passwords are stored with sufficient protection to prevent offline recovery attacks, including local system access. | X	 | OS-Assisted   | HSM   | 522 |5.1.1.1|
| 2.10.4 | Verify passwords, integrations with databases and third-party systems, seeds and internal secrets, and API keys are managed securely and not included in the source code or stored within source code repositories. Such storage SHOULD resist offline attacks. The use of a secure software key store (L1), hardware trusted platform module (TPM), or a hardware security module (L3) is recommended for password storage. | X	 |OS-Assisted   | HSM   | 798 |5.1.1.1|
