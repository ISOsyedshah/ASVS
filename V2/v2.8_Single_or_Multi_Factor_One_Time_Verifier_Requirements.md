# 2.8 Single or Multi Factor One Time Verifier Requirements

Single factor one time passwords (OTPs) are physical or soft tokens that display a continually changing pseudo-random one time challenge. These devices make phishing (impersonation) difficult, but not impossible. This type of authenticator is considered "something you have". Multi-factor tokens are similar to single factor OTPs, but require a valid PIN code, biometric unlocking, USB insertion or NFC pairing or some additional value (such as transaction signing calculators) to be entered to create the final OTP.

| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|-----------:|
| 2.8.1 | Verify that time-based OTPs have a defined lifetime before expiring. | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 613 |5.1.4.2/5.1.5.2|
| 2.8.2 | Verify that symmetric keys used to verify submitted OTPs are highly protected, such as by using a hardware security module or secure operating system based key storage. | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |5.1.4.2/5.1.5.2|
| 2.8.3 | Verify that approved cryptographic algorithms are used in the generation, seeding, and verification. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 326 |5.1.4.2/5.1.5.2|
| 2.8.4 | Verify that time-based OTP can be used only once within the validity period.| X 	 | ✓   | ✓   |287 |.1.4.2/5.1.5.2|
| 2.8.5 | Verify that if a time-based multi factor OTP token is re-used during the validity period, it is logged and rejected with secure notifications being sent to the holder of the device. | X  | ✓   | ✓   | 287 |5.1.5.2|
| 2.8.6 | Verify physical single factor OTP generator can be revoked in case of theft or other loss. Ensure that revocation is immediately effective across logged in sessions, regardless of location.  | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 613 |5.2.1|
| 2.8.7 | Verify that biometric authenticators are limited to use only as secondary factors in conjunction with either something you have and something you know. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 308 |5.2.3|
