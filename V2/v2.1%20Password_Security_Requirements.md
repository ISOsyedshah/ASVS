# 2.1 Password Security Requirements
Passwords, called "Memorized Secrets" by NIST 800-63, include passwords, PINs, unlock patterns, pick the correct kitten or another image element, and passphrases. They are generally considered "something you know", and often used as single factor authenticators. There are significant challenges to the continued use of single-factor authentication, including billions of valid usernames and passwords disclosed on the Internet, default or weak passwords, rainbow tables and ordered dictionaries of the most common passwords.

Applications should strongly encourage users to enrol in multi-factor authentication, and should allow users to re-use tokens they already possess, such as FIDO or U2F tokens, or link to a credential service provider that provides multi-factor authentication.

Credential service providers (CSPs) provide federated identity for users. Users will often have more than one identity with multiple CSPs, such as an enterprise identity using Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity or Google, or consumer identity using Facebook, Twitter, Google, or WeChat, to name a just few common alternatives. This list is not an endorsement of these companies or services, but simply an encouragement for developers to consider the reality that many users have many established identities. Organizations should consider integrating with existing user identities, as per the risk profile of the CSP's strength of identity proofing. For example, it is unlikely a government organization would accept a social media identity as a login for sensitive systems, as it is easy to create fake or throw away identities, whereas a mobile game company may well need to integrate with major social media platforms to grow their active player base.


| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
|  2.1.1 | Verify that user set passwords are at least 12 characters in length. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  2.1.2 | Verify that passwords 64 characters or longer are permitted.  | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  2.1.3 | Verify that passwords can contain spaces and truncation is not performed. Consecutive multiple spaces MAY optionally be coalesced| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 1110 |
|  2.1.4 | Verify that Unicode characters are permitted in passwords. A single Unicode code point is considered a character, so 12 emoji or 64 kanji characters should be valid and permitted. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 1059 |
|  2.1.5 | Verify users can change their password.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  2.1.6 | Verify that password change functionality requires the user's current and new password. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637|
|  2.1.7 | Verify that passwords submitted during account registration, login, and password change are checked against a set of breached passwords either locally (such as the top 1,000 or 10,000 most common passwords which match the system's password policy) or using an external API. If using an API a zero knowledge proof or other mechanism should be used to ensure that the plain text password is not sent or used in verifying the breach status of the password. If the password is breached, the application must require the user to set a new non-breached password. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637 |
|  2.1.8 | Verify that a password strength meter is provided to help users set a stronger password.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  2.1.9 | Verify that there are no password composition rules limiting the type of characters permitted. There should be no requirement for upper or lower case or numbers or special characters. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637|
|  2.1.10 | Verify that there are no periodic credential rotation or password history requirements. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637 |
|  2.1.11 | Verify that "paste" functionality, browser password helpers, and external password managers are permitted. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637|
|  2.1.12 | Verify that the user can choose to either temporarily view the entire masked password, or temporarily view the last typed character of the password on platforms that do not have this as native functionality. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637 |
