# 2.7 Out Of Band Verifier Requirements

In the past, a common out of band verifier would have been an email or SMS containing a password reset link. Attackers use this weak mechanism to reset accounts they don't yet control, such as taking over a person's email account and re-using any discovered reset links. There are better ways to handle out of band verification. Secure out of band authenticators are physical devices that can communicate with the verifier over a secure secondary channel. Examples include push notifications to mobile devices. This type of authenticator is considered "something you have". When a user wishes to authenticate, the verifying application sends a message to the out of band authenticator via a connection to the authenticator directly or indirectly through a third party service. The message contains an authentication code (typically a random six digit number or a modal approval dialog). The verifying application waits to receive the authentication code through the primary channel and compares the hash of the received value to the hash of the original authentication code. If they match, the out of band verifier can assume that the user has authenticated. The ASVS assumes that only a few developers will be developing new out of band authenticators, such as push notifications, and thus the following ASVS controls apply to verifiers, such as authentication API, applications, and single sign-on implementations. If developing a new out of band authenticator, please refer to NIST 800-63B § 5.1.3.1. Unsafe out of band authenticators such as e-mail and VOIP are not permitted. PSTN and SMS authentication are currently "restricted" by NIST and should be deprecated in favor of push notifications or similar. If you need to use telephone or SMS out of band authentication, please see § 5.1.3.3.

| 2.7.1 | Verify that clear text out of band (NIST "restricted") authenticators, such as SMS or PSTN, are not offered by default, and stronger alternatives such as push notifications are offered first. | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 287|5.1.3.2|
| 2.7.2 | Verify that the out of band verifier expires out of band authentication requests, codes, or tokens after 10 minutes. | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 287 |5.1.3.2|
| 2.7.3 | Verify that the out of band verifier authentication requests, codes, or tokens are only usable once, and only for the original authentication request. | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 287 |5.1.3.2|
| 2.7.4 | Verify that the out of band authenticator and verifier communicates over a secure independent channel.| ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 523 |5.1.3.2|
| 2.7.5 | Verify that the out of band verifier retains only a hashed version of the authentication code. | X  | ✓   | ✓   | 256 |5.1.3.2|
| 2.7.6 | Verify that the initial authentication code is generated by a secure random number generator, containing at least 20 bits of entropy (typically a six digital random number is sufficient). | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 310 |5.1.3.2|
