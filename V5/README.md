# V5: Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements

The most common web application security weakness is the failure to properly validate input coming from the
client or the environment before directly using it without any output encoding. This weakness leads to almost all of
the significant vulnerabilities in web applications, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, interpreter
injection, locale/Unicode attacks, file system attacks, and buffer overflows.
