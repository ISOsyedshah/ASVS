# 5.3 Output Encoding and Injection Prevention Requirements

Output encoding close or adjacent to the interpreter in use is critical to the security of any application. Typically, output encoding is not persisted, but used to render the output safe in the appropriate output context for immediate use. Failing to output encode will result in an insecure, injectable, and unsafe application.

| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 5.3.1 | Verify that output encoding is relevant for the interpreter and context required. For example, use encoders specifically for HTML values, HTML attributes, JavaScript, URL Parameters, HTTP headers, SMTP, and others as the context requires, especially from untrusted inputs (e.g. names with Unicode or apostrophes, such as ねこ or O'Hara). | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 116 |
| 5.3.2 | Verify that output encoding preserves the user's chosen character set and locale, such that any Unicode character point is valid and safely handled.  | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 176 |
| 5.3.3 | Verify that context-aware, preferably automated - or at worst, manual - output escaping protects against reflected, stored, and DOM based XSS | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 79 |
| 5.3.4 | Verify that data selection or database queries (e.g. SQL, HQL, ORM, NoSQL) use parameterized queries, ORMs, entity frameworks, or are otherwise protected from database injection attacks.| ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 89 |
| 5.3.5 | Verify that where parameterized or safer mechanisms are not present, context-specific output encoding is used to protect against injection attacks, such as the use of SQL escaping to protect against SQL injection. | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | 89|
| 5.3.6 | Verify that the application projects against JavaScript or JSON injection attacks, including for eval attacks, remote JavaScript includes, CSP bypasses, DOM XSS, and JavaScript expression evaluation. | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | 830|
| 5.3.7 | Verify that the application protects against LDAP Injection vulnerabilities, or that specific security controls to prevent LDAP Injection have been implemented. | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   |943|
| 5.3.8 | Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use contextual command line output encoding. | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | 78|
| 5.3.9 | Verify that the application protects against Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks. | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | 829|
| 5.3.10 | Verify that the application protects against XPath injection or XML injection attacks.  | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | 643|


Note: Using parameterized queries or escaping SQL is not always sufficient; table and column names, ORDER BY and so on, cannot be escaped. The inclusion of escaped user-supplied data in these fields results in failed queries or SQL injection.
Note: The SVG format explicitly allows ECMA script in almost all contexts, so it may not be possible to block all SVG XSS vectors completely. If SVG upload is required, we strongly recommend either serving these uploaded files as text/plain or using a separate user supplied content domain to prevent successful XSS from taking over the application.

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
