# 5.1 Input Validation Requirements

Properly implemented input validation controls, using positive whitelisting and strong data typing, can eliminate more than 90% of all injection attacks. Length and range checks can reduce this further. Building in secure input validation is required during application architecture, design sprints, coding, and unit and integration testing. Although many of these items cannot be found in penetration tests, the results of not implementing them are usually found in V5.3 - Output encoding and Injection Prevention Requirements. Developers and secure code reviewers are recommended to treat this section as if L1 is required for all items to prevent injections.
| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 5.1.1 | Verify that the application has defenses against HTTP parameter pollution attacks, particularly if the application framework makes no distinction about the source of request parameters (GET, POST, cookies, headers, or environment variables).| ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 235 |
| 5.1.2 | Verify that frameworks protect against mass parameter assignment attacks, or that the application has countermeasures to protect against unsafe parameter assignment, such as marking fields private or similar.  | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 915 |
| 5.1.3 | Verify that all input (HTML form fields, REST requests, URL parameters, HTTP headers, cookies, batch files, RSS feeds, etc) is validated using positive validation (whitelisting). | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 20 |
| 5.1.4 | Verify that structured data is strongly typed and validated against a defined schema including allowed characters, length and pattern (e.g. credit card numbers or telephone, or validating that two related fields are reasonable, such as checking that suburb and zip/postcode match). | ✓ 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 20 |
| 5.1.5 | Verify that URL redirects and forwards only allow whitelisted destinations, or show a warning when redirecting to potentially untrusted content.| ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | 601 |

*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
