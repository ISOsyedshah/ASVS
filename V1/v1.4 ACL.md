| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
|  1.4.1 | Verify that trusted enforcement points such as at access control gateways, servers, and serverless functions enforce access controls. Never enforce access controls on the client.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  1.4.2 | Verify that the chosen access control solution is flexible enough to meet the application's needs. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  1.4.3 | Verify enforcement of the principle of least privilege in functions, data files, URLs, controllers, services, and other resources. This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 1110 |
|  1.4.4 | Verify the application uses a single and well-vetted access control mechanism for accessing protected data and resources. All requests must pass through this single mechanism to avoid copy and paste or insecure alternative paths.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 1059 |
|  1.4.5 | Verify that attribute or feature-based access control is used whereby the code checks the user's authorization for a feature/data item rather than just their role. Permissions should still be allocated using roles.  | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637 |
