| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
|  1.14.1 | Verify the segregation of components of differing trust levels through well-defined security controls, firewall rules, API gateways, reverse proxies, cloud-based security groups, or similar mechanisms.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  1.14.2 | Verify that if deploying binaries to untrusted devices makes use of binary signatures, trusted connections, and verified endpoints.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  1.14.3 | Verify that the build pipeline warns of out-of-date or insecure components and takes appropriate actions.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 1110 |
|  1.14.4 | Verify that the build pipeline contains a build step to automatically build and verify the secure deployment of the application, particularly if the application infrastructure is software defined, such as cloud environment build scripts. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 1059 |
|  1.14.5 | Verify that application deployments adequately sandbox, containerize and/or isolate at the network level to delay and deter attackers from attacking other applications, especially when they are performing sensitive or dangerous actions such as deserialization. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | C1. |
|  1.14.6 | Verify the application does not use unsupported, insecure, or deprecated client-side technologies such as NSAPI plugins, Flash, Shockwave, ActiveX, Silverlight, NACL, or client-side Java applets. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 637|
