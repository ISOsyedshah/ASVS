# V1.12 Secure Fiule Upload Architecture Requirements

Applications need to be designed with strong cryptographic architecture to protect data assets as per their classification. Encrypting everything is wasteful, not encrypting anything is legally negligent. A balance must be struck, usually during architectural or high level design, design sprints or architectural spikes. Designing cryptography as you go or retrofitting it will inevitably cost much more to implement securely than simply building it in from the start.
Architectural requirements are intrinsic to the entire code base, and thus difficult to unit or integrate test.

Architectural requirements require consideration in coding standards, throughout the coding phase, and should be reviewed during security architecture, peer or code reviews, or retrospectives.


| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
|  1.12.1 | Verify that user-uploaded files are stored outside of the web root.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |
|  1.12.2 | Verify that user-uploaded files - if required to be displayed or downloaded from the application - are served by either octet stream downloads, or from an unrelated domain, such as a cloud file storage bucket. Implement a suitable content security policy to reduce the risk from XSS vectors or other attacks from the uploaded file.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |
