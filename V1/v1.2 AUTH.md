# V1.2 Authentication Architectural Requirements
When designing authentication, it doesn't matter if you have strong hardware enabled multi-factor authentication if an attacker can reset an account by calling a call center and answering commonly known questions. When proofing identity, all authentication pathways must have the same strength.


| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
| 1.2.1 | Verify the use of unique or special low-privilege operating system accounts for all application components, services, and servers.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 250 |
|  1.2.2 | Verify that communications between application components, including APIs, middleware and data layers, are authenticated. Components should have the least necessary privileges needed. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
|  1.2.3 | Verify that the application uses a single vetted authentication mechanism that is known to be secure, can be extended to include strong authentication, and has sufficient logging and monitoring to detect account abuse or breaches| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
|  1.2.4 | Verify that all authentication pathways and identity management APIs implement consistent authentication security control strength, such that there are no weaker alternatives per the risk of the application. | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 306 |
