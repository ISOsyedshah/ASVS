# V1.6 Cryptographic

Applications need to be designed with strong cryptographic architecture to protect data assets as per their classification. Encrypting everything is wasteful, not encrypting anything is legally negligent. A balance must be struck, usually during architectural or high level design, design sprints or architectural spikes. Designing cryptography as you go or retrofitting it will inevitably cost much more to implement securely than simply building it in from the start.
Architectural requirements are intrinsic to the entire code base, and thus difficult to unit or integrate test.

Architectural requirements require consideration in coding standards, throughout the coding phase, and should be reviewed during security architecture, peer or code reviews, or retrospectives.


| Number       | Description     | L1    		| L2         | L3 		   | CWE		|
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|
|  1.6.1 | Verify that there is an explicit policy for management of cryptographic keys and that a cryptographic key lifecycle follows a key management standard such as NIST SP 800-57.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |
|  1.6.2 | Verify that consumers of cryptographic services protect key material and other secrets by using key vaults or API based alternatives.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |
|  1.6.3 | Verify that all keys and passwords are replaceable and are part of a well-defined process to re-encrypt sensitive data.| X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |
|  1.6.4 | Verify that symmetric keys, passwords, or API secrets generated by or shared with clients are used only in protecting low risk secrets, such as encrypting local storage, or temporary ephemeral uses such as parameter obfuscation. Sharing secrets with clients is clear-text equivalent and architecturally should be treated as such.  | X	 | ✓   | ✓   | 320 |
