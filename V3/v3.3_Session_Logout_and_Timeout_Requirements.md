# 3.3 Session Logout and Timeout Requirements

Session timeouts have been aligned with NIST 800-63, which permits much longer session timeouts than traditionally permitted by security standards. Organizations should review the table below, and if a longer time out is desirable based around the application's risk, the NIST value should be the upper bounds of session idle timeouts. L1 in this context is IAL1/AAL1, L2 is IAL2/AAL3, L3 is IAL3/AAL3. For IAL2/AAL2 and IAL3/AAL3, the shorter idle timeout is, the lower bound of idle times for being logged out or re-authenticated to resume the session.

| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------:|-----------:| -----------:|-----------:|
| 3.3.1 | Verify that logout and expiration invalidate the session token, such that the back button or a downstream relying party does not resume an authenticated session, including across relying parties.  | ✓	 | ✓   | ✓   | 613 |7.1|
| 3.3.2 | If authenticators permit users to remain logged in, verify that re-authentication occurs periodically both when actively used or after an idle period.  | 30 Days  |12 hours or 30 minutes of inactivity, 2FA optional|12 hours or 15 minutes of inactivity, with 2FA| 613 |7.2|
| 3.3.3 | Verify that the application terminates all other active sessions after a successful password change, and that this is effective across the application, federated login (if present), and any relying parties. | 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 613 |  |
| 3.3.4 | Verify that users are able to view and log out of any or all currently active sessions and devices. | X 	 | ✓   | ✓   | 6.13 |7.1|


*Note
Where US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.
